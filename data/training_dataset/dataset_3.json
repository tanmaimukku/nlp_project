        "Story": "In early spring, Lyla, a professional dancer from New Orleans, received a letter of invitation to participate in three dance festivals around the world. They all happened in July. The first one was in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The second one in Marrakech, Morocco, and the third one in Sapporo, Japan. Each dance festival would last for five days and there was a week gap between each festival.",

        "Answer": "7th July",
        "Reasoning": "Each festival lasts for 5 days and there's a week gap between each which means Lyla has 7 days to travel and adjust from Jetlag. She spends 2 days travelling and 2 days adjusting, hence it would take her at least four days. So, if the festival in Buenos Aires ends on the 5th of July, she should leave by the 7th of July to make sure she reaches Marrakech on time."

        "Reasoning": "Each festival lasts for 5 days, which means they end on a Friday. If there's a week (7 days) gap between each, Lyla would spend two days travelling and two days adjusting from jetlag. That means she would start her travel to the next festival on the following Thursday after each festival ends."

        "Answer": "20th of August",
        "Reasoning": "Assuming the same seven-day gap between the festival in Japan and the one in New Orleans, Lyla would need to leave Sapporo at least four days (two for travel, two for jet lag) before the festival in New Orleans. If the festival in New Orleans is in early September, the latest she should leave is in the 3rd week of August, around the 20th."
