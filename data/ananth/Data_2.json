By 2017, the iconic Matterhorn mountain experienced a record-breaking landslide due to reduced stability caused by melting permafrost. In 2022, the traditionally snowy ski resort town of Zermatt faced a snow drought, causing severe economic consequences for local businesses and tourism. Finally, in 2025, the Swiss city of Geneva suffered from intense heatwaves, affecting agriculture and increasing the risk of forest fires.",
