When April 2019 dawned, the rising temperature instigated a rapid melting of glaciers nearby, causing a significant shortage of water as summer approached. After a grueling four months, by the end of July, they were barely managing to deal with the water scarcity, severely affecting agricultural productivity. Plans to restore cultivation and other ordinary activities were thwarted when unexpected heavy rainfall battered the city in December 2020. This severe weather event led to devastating floods, slowly eroding the homes of residents and prompting mass displacement. The floodwaters swept away properties much like how houses get carried away downstream by a rushing river. As the year drew to a close, Vancouver was left reeling from the destruction, a stark antithesis to the bustling metropolis it once was, similar to how a dark, stormy night contrasts with a clear, sunny day.",
