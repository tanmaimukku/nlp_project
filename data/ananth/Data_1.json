Lastly, in December, the freezing winter gusts caused the river to freeze, disrupting Lakewood's fishing industry.",

After continuous labor for several weeks, they managed to reinstate the essential infrastructure of the village, including the lighthouse that was damaged in the cyclone by April 1st. The village had aimed to steadily reintroduce daily life activities, but to their dismay, they had to confront an unpredicted sandstorm, fueled by extraordinary desert winds, on the 10th of April. This sudden disaster led to the recently reconstructed village lighthouse being utterly destroyed, thereby separating Westbay from adjacent seaports. Now, it would take extra hours to reach these seaports. Moving further into the year, the intense summer heat in August triggered a severe water shortage, hampering the recovery from the cyclone and sandstorm. Finally, in December, an unexpected hailstorm rolled in, causing the sea waters to freeze over, making a significant blow to Westbay's fishing industry.",
