    "Story": "In 1982, the grand national Baptist revival was held in Nashville, Tennessee, attracting thousands of worshippers from across the country. Five years later, in 1987, the same revival event was conducted in Atlanta, Georgia with even larger attendance. Following the huge success of the revival in Atlanta, the authorities decided to host the event in Houston, Texas in 1992. The gathering in Houston turned out to be a massive affair and people called it 'The Great Houston Revival'. The revival then continued rotating through different states of the USA and was organized in Los Angeles, California in 1997.",
